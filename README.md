Iris is a system to coordinate complex measurements from multiple vantage points.

Its main features are:
- Handle multi-round measurements, such as [diamond-miner](https://github.com/dioptra-io/diamond-miner) IP tracing measurements.
- Handle both centralized computation on a powerful server, and distributed probing on smaller agents.
- Can tolerate the temporary loss of agents, database or control-plane.
- Support IPv6 and IPv4 measurements.
